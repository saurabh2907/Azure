---question 1 . difference betwwn Union and Union all

UNION: Combines the results of two queries and removes duplicate rows.
UNION ALL: Combines the results of two queries without removing duplicate

--question 2 . primary key vs union difference 
primary key - Used to serve as a unique identifier for each row in a table.
Cannot accept NULL values.
Only one primary key

UNIQUE KEY- Uniquely determines a row that isn’t the primary key.
Can accept NULL values.
More than one unique key

emp_id  primary key     mobile nmber unique




--question difference between rank and dense rank 
RANK(): Skips ranks if there are ties.
DENSE_RANK(): Does not skip ranks, even if there are ties.

rank      dense rank     salary 
1          1             100000
2          2              70000
2          2              70000
4           3             50000


--questiuon 4 . delete vs drop vs truncate 

The TRUNCATE command helps us delete the complete records from an existing table

The DROP command drops the existing table from the database. It only requires the name of the table to be dropped.

The SQL DELETE command is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command that deletes existing
records from the table in the database. It can delete one or more rows from the table
depending on the condition given with the WHERE clause

--question 5. what are different windows function 

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Examples include:

ROW_NUMBER()
RANK()
DENSE_RANK()
AVG() OVER()

--question 6 . where and having clause difference
WHERE: Filters rows before grouping (GROUP BY).
HAVING: Filters groups created by GROUP BY.

--question 7. how to handle null values in sql 
Use functions like:
IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to filter records.
COALESCE(column, default_value) to replace NULL with a default value.

--8. SQL constraints 

-- Definition:
--SQL constraints are rules applied to columns in a database table
--to enforce data integrity and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
1. NOT NULL
Definition: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
2. UNIQUE
Definition: Ensures that all values in a column are unique across the table,
preventing duplicate entries.
3.PRIMARY KEY
Definition: A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
It uniquely identifies each row in a table and cannot accept NULL values.
4.FOREIGN KEY
Definition: Establishes a relationship between two tables by ensuring that a value in one table
matches a value in another, maintaining referential integrity.
5.CHECK
Definition: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition, 
helping to enforce business rules.
6.DEFAULT
definition: Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified during the insertion of a new record.

-- A PRIMARY KEY is a column (or a set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
-- No two rows can have the same primary key value, and it can’t be NULL.

-- IT DOESNT CONTAIN DUPLICATE VALUE   
-- IT CANT BE NULL 
-- WE CAN HAVE ONLY 1 PRIMARY KEY IN THE TABLE

-- joining in sql --
✅ What is a JOIN in SQL?
The JOIN clause is used to combine  two or more tables based on a common column
between them. This helps retrieve related data efficiently. --

-- Types of SQL JOINs

--1. INNER JOIN: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
--2.LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table 
and the matching rows from the right table.
--3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows
from the left table.
--4. FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table,
with NULL for non-matching rows.

--- WINDOWS FUNCTION 
-- OVER CLAUSE AND PARTITION BY 

-- OVER 
--The OVER clause in SQL is used with window functions (like SUM, COUNT, ROW_NUMBER, etc.) 
--to perform calculations across a specific set of rows related to the current row.

--The OVER clause allows for partitioning and ordering rows
--without collapsing them into a single result like aggregate


--In SQL, window functions perform calculations across a specified range of rows 
--that are related to the current row, without collapsing 
--them into a single row as aggregate functions do. 

--This allows for advanced analytical queries, such as ranking, running totals, moving averages, and more.

--Types of Window Functions
-- Aggregate Functions: SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT()
-- Ranking Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE()
-- Value Functions: LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()

----A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a temporary result set that you can
--reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

--CTEs are often used to simplify complex queries,
--make queries more readable, and allow for recursive queries.

--CTEs are powerful for organizing SQL code, 
--especially in multi-step analyses or when calculating intermediate results.

--Reusable Logic: Once defined, you can refer to a CTE multiple times within the main query.

--1. A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

--2. if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

--3.You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

---- triggers in sql

A trigger in SQL is a set of instructions that automatically execute in response to specific events on a particular table or view. Triggers are typically used to enforce business rules, maintain audit trails, and automate tasks such as calculations or updates when changes are made to a database.

Trigger Types
BEFORE Trigger: Executes before an operation (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) is completed.
AFTER Trigger: Executes after an operation is completed.
INSTEAD OF Trigger: Typically used on views to handle what happens instead of a default INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE action.
